This folder contains the Python code for two lambda functions, `sync-canvas-data-files` and `fetch-canvas-data-file`. For convenience both of these function libraries and all of their dependencies are packaged into a single ZIP file for deployment on AWS.

To build the zip file, run `./build.sh` from this folder. Note that you will need `zip` and `pip3` installed in order to run the build script.
